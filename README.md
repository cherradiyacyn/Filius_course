[FILIUS](https://www.lernsoftware-filius.de/) was initially developed by the University Siegen, Germany, to provide a tool for enhancing computer science lessons on networks. The main target group are students of secondary schools but with its wide range of applications it can be interesting for learners of any age. The software especially promotes explorative learning and is very helpful to teach students about the internet and its various applications.

I use this tool to teach Computer Networking to my 6th grade students in Elementary School.
